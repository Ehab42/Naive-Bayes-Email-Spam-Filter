\section{Results}
This section covers the results our model achieved and a description of our used dataset for training and testing the model.

\subsection{Dataset description}
We use a dataset consisting of 5572 ham and spam SMS messages which are not chronologically sorted \cite{dataset}. We first randomize the whole dataset and then split it to 80\% train and 20\% test data, respectively, which results in 4458 entries for training data and 1114 for test data. After that we validate the splitting process by taking a look at the label distributions. We've found that we have around 86\% ham and 14\% spam messages in the training data whereas the test data has around 87\% ham and 23\% spam messages. We can conclude that this is a good data distribution for both datasets as there are a lot more ham than spam messages in the real world.
